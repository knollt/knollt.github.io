Sometime last year, I started to toy with the idea of expanding my mind from a rigid, black and white area to a more creative area.  I knew this was going to be an uphill challenge and the process is going to test a person's resolve, learning capabilities.   

Over the years, my work experiences have exposed me to the development process and other relatible technical aspects.  I figured or realized that coding skils are going to be vital to a person's skill set as technology keeps advancing.   Just in the past year cryptocurrency and blockchain has started to spread throughout more industries. My biggest mistake or issue is that I have not coded a single syntax for more than ten years besides your common Microsoft excel, SQL, or company ERP system software.  So the new adventure begins now.

I started slowly with some online courses via Pluralsight, Udemy, and other sites to test myself and confirm my level of interest.  Over a few months and a couple of projects later, the process captured my love to build/create things.  There is something to be said to build something from scratch.  After completing the courses, I still felt there were learning gaps.  After some research, I found and attended a couple bootcamps preps to learn and to absorb the different camps teaching style.  Unfortunately due to geographically restrictions, my access to qualiity bootcamps is limited.

My findings thus far are the concepts are the same across languages, but the challenge is learning the different syntax with each language and the multitude of concepts to remember or Google.  The most challenging concept for me is object-oriented programming.

To be continued...
